# Heart_Disease_Analysis

A Machine Learning Project used to predict if the patient/person has heart disease or not

The heart disease dataset contains different medical information about the patient. It has 303 instances with 14 variables each. The dataset is good for classification task. The model can be used to predict if the person/patient has heart disease or not.

This is binary classification problem and can perform various different algorithms like logistic regression, decision tree random forests, etc and differentiate between the models and analyze their performances.

The dataset is preprocessed since there will be missing values and inappropriate data. To understand the data I have performed data visualization to help us in training the model. After preprocessing the data, feature engineering is performed in order to choose the appropriate and important attributes which has the greatest influence for the correct prediction. To train the model data is split into training set, validation set and test set. Training set is used for training the machine learning model, validation set is used for hyper parameter tuning of selected model and test set is used for evaluating the model. 

Hence, when new data is given to predict, then the model which performed best while training is does the job to predict the target.

Outcome
•	Conducted exploratory data analysis on the dataset to understand the relationship between variables
•	Using supervised machine learning algorithms, the model is trained and tested 
•	The logistic regression algorithm gave the highest accuracy of 92%
